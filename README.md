# PlantGuard: A Plant Disease Detection System 🌱

## Overview
PlantGuard is an intelligent deep learning-based plant disease detection system designed to help farmers and gardeners identify and manage crop diseases effectively. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the system classifies images of plant leaves into different disease categories across 9 different plant types, enabling early detection and timely intervention.

**Deployed Version:** Access the live application on the Streamlit platform [here](https://plant-guard.streamlit.app/).

## Supported Plants & Diseases

The system can detect **26+ different conditions** across **9 plant types**:

## Methodology
The project employs **DenseNet**, a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture known for its dense connectivity pattern, which enhances feature propagation and encourages feature reuse. Each plant type has a dedicated fine-tuned model trained on the PlantVillage dataset, ensuring specialized and accurate disease classification.

**Model Architecture:**
- Base: DenseNet (pre-trained on ImageNet)
- Input Size: 256x256 pixels
- Output: Multi-class classification (plant-specific diseases)
- Total Models: 9 specialized models (one per plant type)

## Features
✅ Detection of 26+ plant diseases across 9 crop types  
✅ User-friendly web interface with real-time predictions  
✅ Comprehensive disease information including:
  - Detailed descriptions
  - Symptoms identification
  - Treatment recommendations
  - Preventive measures  
✅ Plant type selection for targeted disease detection

## Dataset
The project uses the **PlantVillage Dataset** with the following structure:
- **Training Set**: Images organized by plant type and disease category
- **Validation Set**: Separate validation images for model tuning
- **Test Set**: Hold-out test set for final evaluation

Images are RGB, resized to 256x256 pixels for model input.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Virtual environment (recommended)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
